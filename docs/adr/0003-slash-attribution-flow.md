# Slashing policy & attribution flow

Status: accepted

> Ported from [`bleu/cow-byos-architecture` ADR-0003](https://github.com/bleu/cow-byos-architecture/blob/main/docs/adr/0003-slash-attribution-flow.md). This is the canonical, service-side version of the policy; [`bleu/byos-contracts` ADR-0004](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-penalty-schedule-and-attribution.md) is a contract-scoped extract of the same decision. The escrow mechanics referenced here (debit, freeze, events) are implemented as an ERC20 ledger per [contracts ADR-0007](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-erc20-escrow-token.md); use `effectiveBalance()` for eligibility checks.

## Context

When CoW imposes a cost on BYOS, BYOS must attribute it to the responsible sub-solver and recover it from escrow ([contracts ADR-0002](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-escrow-contract.md)) — without being able to fabricate a slash against an honest sub-solver. Two coupled sub-decisions from the [economics design note](https://github.com/bleu/cow-byos-architecture/blob/main/docs/design/byos-subsolver-economics.md):

- **Q3** — Track-B arbiter: who adjudicates EBBO/fairness passthrough claims?
- **Q4** — Attribution: how does BYOS map a settlement to the responsible sub-solver?

CoW's own penalty framework has four enforcement layers (see [`../reference/cow-solver-slashing-policy.md`](../reference/cow-solver-slashing-policy.md)):

1. **Smart contract** (limit price reverts, whitelist) — architecturally prevented by the Trampoline ([contracts ADR-0001](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-trampoline-topology.md)); sub-solvers never call `settle`.
2. **Automated off-chain** (participation guards, banning) — subsumed by BYOS's gatekeeping + Track A escrow debits + collateral gate. No separate replication needed.
3. **DAO governance** (EBBO, score inflation, surplus shifts, overbidding, hooks, catch-all) — only **EBBO/unfair pricing** and the **catch-all** apply to sub-solvers. Score inflation, illegal buffer usage, surplus shifting, and overbidding are either architecturally prevented or are BYOS's own responsibility (BYOS controls score construction, buffer access, and settlement composition).
4. **Economic penalties** (reward formula, `missingScore`, `c_l` cap) — mirrored via the Track A `gas + c_l` debit. Sub-solvers receive no rewards in v1, so the escrow debit is the only lever.

### Hooks and sub-solver responsibility

Hooks are handled by BYOS and the driver, not by sub-solvers (COW-1243). The orderbook pre-encodes hooks as `HooksTrampoline.execute()` calls; BYOS includes them in simulation for accurate gas estimates, and the driver appends them to the settlement. Sub-solvers submit routing proposals without hook interactions — their EIP-712 signature covers the route, not the hooks. Some hooks (e.g., withdrawing DEX liquidity before a swap) change the token balances available for the route; sub-solvers must account for their effects when computing routes, but do not encode or submit them.

## Decision

### Penalty schedule

| Scenario | Track | Amount | Timing | Dispute | Arbiter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Settlement reverts on-chain | A | `gas + c_l` | Immediate debit | 72h | BYOS |
| Settlement misses block deadline | A | `gas + c_l` | Immediate debit | 72h | BYOS |
| Won auction, BYOS chose not to settle | A (non-settlement) | 10% of `c_l` | Immediate debit | 72h | BYOS |
| EBBO / unfair pricing | B | CoW certificate amount | Freeze on receipt | 36h | CoW core team |
| Catch-all malicious behavior | B | CoW-determined amount | Freeze on receipt | 36h | CoW core team |

**Stacking:** Track A and Track B penalties for the same settlement stack. No crediting of Track A against Track B — if a settlement causes both a revert and an EBBO ruling, the sub-solver pays both.

### Track A — revert & gas penalties (routine, fast, provable)

| Stage | Actor | What happens | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Chain | Settlement tx reverts, misses deadline, or BYOS elects not to settle after winning | T₀ |
| Debit | BYOS | Debits `gas + c_l` (revert/deadline) or `0.1 × c_l` (non-settlement) from sub-solver's escrow | T₀ + seconds |
| Dispute | Sub-solver | 72h window; narrow grounds: wrong attribution, tx didn't revert, amount exceeds `gas + c_l` | 72h |
| Resolution | BYOS | BYOS reviews and decides (unilateral) | After dispute window |

Track A is BYOS-unilateral. For reverts and deadline misses, everything is on-chain-verifiable (tx receipt, gas cost, Trampoline CREATE2 address → sub-solver attribution per [contracts ADR-0001](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-trampoline-topology.md)). The non-settlement sub-category is based on BYOS's internal auction records and is not independently verifiable by the sub-solver — this is an accepted trust assumption.

**Non-settlement detection** (decided with COW-1205): a driver `Cancelled`/`Expired`/`Fail` notification for an `Executing` proposal is the trigger — the driver confirmed it began submitting (`SettlementStarted`, [ADR-0010](0010-settlement-outcome-source.md)) and then abandoned the settlement with no tx landing, which covers both submission failures and the driver's own block deadline (a few blocks per chain). The executing-*timeout* release ([ADR-0013](0013-proposal-lifecycle-and-retention.md)) is **not** charged: a lost notification is not proof of non-settlement.

### Track B — EBBO / fairness passthrough (rare, slow, CIP-52 mirror)

```
CoW core team ──EBBO certificate──▶ BYOS ──slash claim──▶ sub-solver S
   (72h for BYOS to comply/challenge)     (36h window inside BYOS's 72h)
```

| Stage | Actor | What happens | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger | CoW core team | EBBO certificate against a BYOS settlement | T_c (days to 3 months post-trade) |
| Identify | BYOS | Maps cited settlement → proposal → sub-solver S | T_c + minutes |
| Freeze + notify | Escrow operator | `freeze(S)` blocks withdrawal; BYOS notifies S with full evidence (certificate, settlement ref, amount) | T_c + minutes |
| Challenge | S → BYOS → CoW | S supplies refutation within 36h; BYOS relays into its CoW challenge | 36h |
| Resolution | CoW | Upholds or overturns | Within BYOS's 72h |
| Settle | BYOS + Escrow | Upheld: operator calls `debit(S, amount, reason)`, BYOS reimburses CoW; shortfall → BYOS absorbs. Overturned: `unfreeze(S)` | After resolution |

Arbiter: **CoW core team** — they already adjudicate EBBO; routing Track B to them ensures BYOS cannot fabricate a certificate. Sub-solvers receive the same evidence standard, challenge window, and appeal rights that CoW gives BYOS.

### Attribution (Q4): one sub-solver per settlement tx

Enforce **one sub-solver per settlement tx**. The per-sub-solver Trampoline CREATE2 address ([contracts ADR-0001](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-trampoline-topology.md)) in the settlement calldata self-evidences which sub-solver's route ran — no reliance on BYOS's private records. This makes Track A debits indisputable and Track B attribution clean.

Cost: less batching efficiency. Accepted — clean attribution is worth more than marginal gas savings from multi-sub-solver settlements.

### `c_l` values

Referenced from CoW's reward mechanism by pointer (read from CoW's accounting/reward contract or API at debit time). Hardcoded fallback for v1 if the on-chain source isn't cleanly accessible. Current values:

| Chain | `c_l` |
|---|---|
| Ethereum | 0.010 ETH |
| Gnosis | 10 xDAI |

### Minimum escrow balance

Sized to cover worst-case Track A: `gas + c_l` for a single settlement. This keeps the barrier to entry low for a permissionless system. Track B is inherently under-collateralized (claims arrive months later, in a different token); gatekeeping is the primary Track B defense, not escrow sizing.

### Escrow shortfall

If a Track B claim exceeds the sub-solver's escrow balance, BYOS drains the remaining balance and absorbs the shortfall. The sub-solver is naturally suspended (zero collateral = ineligible for proposals). No permanent ban, no debt tracking — bans are meaningless in a permissionless system; the escrow loss is the penalty.

### Gatekeeping (best-effort, non-exculpatory)

BYOS validates proposals before settlement:

- **Simulation** — proposal must not revert against the reference block. For hooked orders, the order's pre-encoded hook interactions are included in simulation for accurate gas estimates.
- **Baseline price check** — route must not be obviously worse than reference AMM prices (EBBO baseline).

Passing gatekeeping does not absolve the sub-solver of liability if CoW later determines the settlement violated protocol rules. Gatekeeping reduces risk; it does not eliminate it.

### Transparency

The escrow's on-chain events are the public record of every penalty action ([contracts ADR-0002](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-escrow-contract.md) defines the event set). No additional public reporting or dashboard. BYOS notifies the affected sub-solver privately with full evidence for any penalty. The `_reason` convention on `debit`: the settlement tx hash for Track A reverts, the order UID hash for non-settlement (no tx exists), the claim ID for Track B.

### Policy lifecycle

Immutable for v1. No unilateral updates. Changes require a v2 policy with a new escrow deployment or migration.

## Alternatives considered

- **Replicate all four CoW enforcement layers.** Rejected — Layers 1 and 2 are either architecturally prevented or already covered by gatekeeping + escrow + collateral gate. Adding separate participation guards (ban timers) would be redundant.
- **Pass all Layer 3 violations through to sub-solvers** (score inflation, buffer abuse, surplus shifting, overbidding). Rejected — sub-solvers cannot cause most of these violations. BYOS controls score construction, buffer access, and settlement composition. Listing violations sub-solvers can't commit would be confusing.
- **Sub-solvers encode hooks in their proposals.** Reversed (COW-1243) — BYOS now handles hooks: the orderbook pre-encodes them, BYOS includes them in simulation, and the driver appends them to the settlement. Sub-solvers provide only routing interactions. Hooks that change token state (e.g., LP withdrawal before swap) affect the route but are not the sub-solver's responsibility to encode.
- **No penalty for non-settlement** (BYOS wins auction but doesn't settle). Rejected — non-settlement degrades BYOS's participation-guard standing with CoW. Sub-solvers should internalize this cost.
- **Credit Track A against Track B for the same settlement.** Rejected — if both penalties hit BYOS, the sub-solver should pay both. The sub-solver's proposal caused both problems.
- **Formal dispute mechanism for Track A with external arbiter.** Rejected — Track A is on-chain-verifiable. BYOS-unilateral adjudication is sufficient given the trust model. Sub-solvers trust BYOS as operator.
- **Public slashing dashboard / reporting.** Rejected — leaks competitive intelligence about sub-solver routing quality. On-chain escrow events are sufficient for the sub-solver to audit their own history.
- **Permanent ban or debt tracking on escrow shortfall.** Rejected — meaningless in a permissionless system. New address = new identity. The escrow loss itself is the penalty.
- **Higher minimum escrow (proportional to order value, or fixed large amount).** Rejected — Track B is inherently under-collateralized regardless of minimum size. Low barriers to entry matter for a permissionless system. `gas + c_l` covers the common case (Track A).
- **Versioned or updatable policy.** Rejected for v1 — adds complexity. Ship, learn, revisit in v2.

## Consequences

- **Sub-solvers trust BYOS for Track A adjudication.** BYOS is both debitor and dispute judge. Mitigation: Track A parameters are on-chain-verifiable; a provably incorrect debit is an operational bug, not a policy failure. All debits emit events with reasons.
- **Track B has an unrecoverable gap.** If the sub-solver withdrew or escrow < claim, BYOS absorbs the shortfall. This is why gatekeeping is mandatory — it is the primary Track B defense.
- **Non-settlement penalty (10% of `c_l`) relies on BYOS's internal records.** Sub-solvers cannot independently verify that BYOS won an auction with their proposal. Accepted trust assumption, consistent with the operator trust model.
- **One sub-solver per settlement tx reduces batching efficiency.** Accepted — clean attribution enables indisputable Track A debits and clean Track B passthrough.
- **Immutable v1 policy means no ability to adjust parameters.** If 10% of `c_l` for non-settlement proves too low or too high, it stays until v2. Mitigated by conservative initial sizing and the expectation that v1 is a learning phase.
- **36h sub-solver challenge window for Track B is tight.** Sub-solvers need responsive operations to gather evidence within 36h. Permissionless participants without 24/7 ops may struggle. Accepted — BYOS needs the remaining 36h of its 72h CoW window to process and relay.
- **The service tracks a 5× off-chain reserve against pending Track-B claims** ([contracts ADR-0002](https://github.com/bleu/byos-contracts/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-escrow-contract.md)): no on-chain reserve multiplier exists, so reserve calculation and proposal-eligibility math are a BYOS-service responsibility and a critical path.
