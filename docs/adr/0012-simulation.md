# Simulation

Status: accepted

## Context

This ADR settles how proposals are simulated, how the gas result flows into scoring, and the continuous re-validation of active proposals.

Depends on: [ADR-0001](0001-proposal-api.md) (proposal lifecycle), [ADR-0002](0002-solver-engine.md) (solver engine scoring).

The design was proven end-to-end by a mainnet fork spike (COW-1181, 2026-07-27): a real orderbook order was settled through a freshly deployed trampoline from an unprivileged sender using only the two state overrides below.

## Decision

### Simulation dispatch: a full one-trade `settle()` from a dummy submitter

Each proposal is simulated as the transaction the CoW-run driver would actually submit — a real `settle()` on GPv2Settlement:

```
eth_estimateGas:
  from: 0x1111...1111 (dummy submitter)
  to:   GPv2Settlement
  data: settle(
          tokens         = [sellToken, buyToken],
          clearingPrices = [proposal.buyAmount, proposal.sellAmount],
          trades         = [the real order: fields and signature from the orderbook],
          interactions   = [[], [sellToken.transfer(trampoline, sellAmount),
                                 trampoline.execute(...)], []]
        )
state overrides:
  authenticator -> code: AnyoneAuthenticator (vendored from cowprotocol/services, MIT)
  escrow        -> state_diff: hasRole(SUBMITTER_ROLE, dummy) = true
```

Because the order is real, the user has genuinely approved the vault relayer and holds the sell tokens — no balance faking, no allowance faking, no per-token storage-slot detection. Everything runs at real addresses, so the trampoline's floor-and-sweep semantics (contracts ADR-0003) behave exactly as production, and GPv2's own checks (order signature, limit price, validTo, filled amount) come along for free.

Using `eth_estimateGas` (rather than `eth_call` + a separate gas estimation step) gives both the success/revert verdict and the gas consumed in a single RPC call.

**What the simulation does not model.** "The transaction the driver would actually submit" is true of the trade, the interactions and the addresses, but not literally of three calldata words. `byos_common::settlement::encode_settle` sets `executedAmount` to the proposal's fill amount (correct for both fill-or-kill and partial fills — the envelope guarantees proposal == order for fill-or-kill) and `clearingPrices` to the raw proposal amounts. The driver's real transaction declares `executedAmount = sellAmount − gasCut` ([ADR-0002](0002-solver-engine.md) §Gas cut) and then substitutes its own per-trade prices (`Trade::custom_prices`), which for a sell order come out as `{sell: (sellAmount − cut) × proposal.buyAmount / proposal.sellAmount, buy: sellAmount}`. It also applies protocol fees, which depend on policies that only exist in the `/solve` payload.

Neither is threaded through the encoder, for two reasons. The gas is the same: same tokens, same interactions, same trade, same storage touched, only three word values differ. And the divergence is one-directional — the real transaction pays the user less than the simulated one, never more — so a proposal that simulates successfully cannot fail the settlement's limit check because of the cut. Threading it would also mean giving the encoder the auction's gas price, which the validation loop holds only as a last-seen value, so the estimate would gain a dependency on auction state without changing.

The two overrides stand in for permissions the dummy sender lacks:

- **Authenticator** (resolved once via `settlement.authenticator()`, cached): code override with `AnyoneAuthenticator`, so any `from` passes the solver allowlist.
- **Escrow**: a `state_diff` write granting `SUBMITTER_ROLE` to the dummy (`tx.origin` check in the trampoline). The Escrow inherits **non-upgradeable** OpenZeppelin v5 `AccessControl`, so `_roles` lives at plain storage slot 5 (after ERC20's five slots): the slot is `keccak256(pad32(account) ++ keccak256(pad32(role) ++ pad32(5)))`. This is NOT the ERC-7201 namespaced slot the upgradeable variant uses — an earlier draft assumed it and every simulation reverted on the fork.

Once a production submitter address holds `SUBMITTER_ROLE` on-chain, a `--submitter-address` arg can replace the dummy and both overrides become unnecessary.

### Order data: fetched from the orderbook, cached forever

The order (amounts, validTo, appData, receiver, signature, signing scheme, balance flavors, fullAppData) is fetched from `GET /api/v1/orders/{uid}` on the CoW orderbook (`--orderbook-url`, required alongside `--rpc-url`). `POST /proposals` does NOT carry token addresses — the orderbook order is the single source of truth, which removes a lying-client hazard.

Orders are immutable once placed, so fetches are cached for the process lifetime. Known staleness: an off-chain soft-cancel is invisible to this service — the proposal's own `validUntil` bounds the window, and the driver re-validates orders at settlement time, so nothing wrong can land on-chain. Fetch failures: 404 rejects the proposal (`OrderNotFound`); anything transient defers to the next tick.

### Validation envelope: which orders get simulated at all

Before simulating, the order/proposal pair must pass the envelope (cheap, no RPC):

- **Hooks supported** — order hooks are included in simulation for accurate gas estimates via the order's pre-encoded `interactions` from the orderbook API (already trampoline-wrapped). The `/solve` response does NOT include hooks — the driver appends the order's own hooks itself. **Hooks + partial fills interaction:** the CoW social consensus is that pre-hooks execute only on the first fill (`executed_amount == 0`), while post-hooks execute on every fill. Because orders are cached by UID for the process lifetime, pre-interactions are always present in simulation regardless of fill history. This overestimates gas for non-first fills of hooked orders (conservative: never under-counts, but reduces surplus slightly). See the `SimulationParams` doc comments for detail.
- **erc20 balance flavors only** — `external`/`internal` balance orders reject (`UnsupportedOrder`).
- **Fill-or-kill amounts consistent** — sell fill-or-kill needs `proposal.sellAmount == order.sellAmount`; buy needs `proposal.buyAmount == order.buyAmount` (`AmountMismatch`). Fill-or-kill executes the order amount in full; a proposal quoting anything else would simulate a different trade than the one the driver settles.
- **Partial fill amounts within limits** — the fill must be non-zero, must not exceed the signed order amount, and must respect the order's limit price. The limit price is checked via cross-multiplication to avoid division (`proposal_buy * order_sell >= proposal_sell * order_buy` for sell orders, reversed for buy orders). Overflow in the cross-multiplication rejects the proposal. The `executedAmount` in the simulation's trade encoding uses the proposal amounts (correct for both partial and full fills — the envelope guarantees proposal == order for fill-or-kill).

All four signature schemes (eip712, ethsign, eip1271, presign) are supported: the scheme is encoded into the trade's `flags` word and GPv2 verifies the signature for real during the simulation. Sell and buy orders are both supported, including native-ETH buys.

### Trampoline resolution: `TrampolineFactory.addressOf` at validation time

The simulation needs a trampoline address. It is resolved by calling `TrampolineFactory.addressOf(sub_solver)` on-chain during the first validation pass (`Submitted` -> `Active`). Results are cached per sub-solver in a `HashMap<Address, Address>` -- trampoline addresses are deterministic (CREATE2) and never change, so the cache is persistent across ticks.

The resolved trampoline is stored on the `Proposal` struct and used by both re-validation (no re-resolution needed) and `/solve` (for encoding settlement interactions). The order's token addresses are stored on the proposal the same way (via the `Accept` verdict) for `/solve` scoring and encoding.

### Gas in scoring: simulated gas + 30k buffer

The simulated gas is stored on the `Proposal` struct (`gas_used: Option<u64>`) after a successful simulation. `/solve` scoring uses `gas = gas_used + GAS_BUFFER` where `GAS_BUFFER = 30_000`. The buffer is small by design: the full-settle estimate already covers intrinsic gas and the entire settlement path, so it only absorbs warm/cold storage differences and driver batching variance. (The old 100k buffer compensated for a simulation that under-measured the real transaction.)

Proposals without `gas_used` (not yet simulated) are skipped by `/solve` -- they are never scored or returned as solutions.

The old fixed `GAS_ESTIMATE` constant is retained only for the escrow balance threshold calculation (renamed to `ESCROW_GAS_ESTIMATION`), which runs before simulation and needs a conservative floor.

### Continuous re-validation of active proposals

The background validation loop validates `Submitted` and `Active` proposals on every tick — `Executing` proposals (settlement in flight) are not simulated ([ADR-0013](0013-proposal-lifecycle-and-retention.md)). For `Submitted` proposals, a successful validation transitions them to `Active` and writes `gas_used`, `trampoline`, and the order's token addresses; this first pass also applies the profitability gate — a non-positive score rejects as `Unprofitable` ([ADR-0013](0013-proposal-lifecycle-and-retention.md)). For `Active` proposals, re-validation updates `gas_used` with the fresh simulation result; if the simulation now reverts, the proposal transitions to `SimFailed`. The profitability gate is not re-applied on re-validation.

This catches proposals that become invalid due to on-chain state changes (pool liquidity moved, user balance changed, order filled or invalidated on-chain, etc.) without waiting for the driver's post-encoding re-simulation.

### Error handling: defer on transport errors, fail on reverts

- **Simulation reverts** (the EVM executed the call and it failed): verdict is `SimFailed`, the proposal is permanently dropped.
- **Transport errors** (RPC timeout, DNS failure, connection refused): verdict is deferred (`None`), the proposal stays in its current state and is retried next tick. A broken RPC should not punish sub-solvers.
- **Trampoline resolution errors**: same deferral policy -- transport errors defer, server errors (contract revert) are treated as real failures.
- **Orderbook errors**: 404 rejects (`OrderNotFound`); transient errors defer.

### Validator architecture: `ValidateProposal` trait + composite `ProposalValidator`

The `ProposalValidator` trait is renamed to `ValidateProposal` (verb form, idiomatic Rust for traits). The composite struct takes the name `ProposalValidator` -- it holds an `EscrowValidator` and a `SimulationValidator` and runs them in sequence:

1. Escrow check (cheap, per-tick cached balance read)
2. Simulation (orderbook fetch — cached after the first pass — then envelope check, then the `eth_estimateGas` RPC call)

Short-circuits on the first non-`Accept` verdict. The `Verdict::Accept` variant carries `gas_used: Option<u64>`, `trampoline: Option<Address>`, and `tokens: Option<(Address, Address)>`, which the store writes onto the proposal.

### Configuration: `--settlement-address`, `--orderbook-url`

`--settlement-address` (env: `SETTLEMENT_ADDRESS`) is the GPv2Settlement contract address, the simulation's `to`. `--orderbook-url` (env: `ORDERBOOK_URL`) is the CoW orderbook base URL (e.g. `https://api.cow.fi/mainnet`). Both are required when `--rpc-url` is set.

## Alternatives rejected

### A. Settlement calls itself with a fake `settle()`

Empty trades plus three intra-interactions, the first being `transferFrom(user, settlement, sellAmount)`. Rejected: users approve the **VaultRelayer**, not the settlement, so the `transferFrom` reverts on real mainnet state for every real order.

### B. ERC-20 balance state overrides on the trampoline

Call `trampoline.execute()` directly, faking the trampoline's sell-token balance via `state_diff` on the token's `balanceOf` slot. Rejected: detecting the balance slot of an arbitrary ERC-20 is fragile per-token probing with ongoing maintenance (different Solidity layouts, Solady, proxies). CoW's own quote verifier needs an entire crate plus `debug_traceCall` for this.

### C. Trampoline code override at the user's address

Copy the trampoline's bytecode onto the user's address and call `execute()` from the settlement; the user's real balance funds the route. Rejected: under the contracts' floor-and-sweep semantics (byos-contracts #27), "the instance" would be the user, so the sweep drags the user's pre-existing buy-token balance into the floor delta — a user who already holds buy tokens makes a worthless route pass. Also failed to exercise the vault-relayer pull and mis-simulated routes that hardcode the real trampoline address.

### D. `simulateExecute()` on the trampoline

A revert-at-the-end simulation entrypoint in the trampoline bytecode (Uniswap Quoter pattern). Workable, but strictly worse than the full settle: new audit surface on the contracts, a synthetic call shape instead of the real settlement, no vault-relayer or GPv2-checks coverage, and `eth_call` + revert-data decoding instead of a single `eth_estimateGas`.

## Consequences

- **`POST /proposals` carries no token addresses.** The orderbook is the source of truth; the reference `subsolver` client already matches this contract.
- **The orderbook is a runtime dependency of validation.** If it is down, proposals defer (they are not rejected). One fetch per order uid over the process lifetime.
- **Proposals without simulation are invisible to `/solve`.** In `AcceptAll` mode (no RPC), `/solve` returns empty solutions. This is correct -- without chain connectivity, proposals cannot be meaningfully scored or settled.
- **RPC load scales with active proposals.** Every active proposal is re-simulated on every tick. The trampoline and authenticator caches mitigate the lookups, but `eth_estimateGas` runs every tick for every live proposal. Acceptable for the expected M1 proposal volume — and bounded per proposal by the ingestion lifetime cap ([ADR-0013](0013-proposal-lifecycle-and-retention.md)).
- **Hooked orders are supported** (COW-1243). The orderbook pre-encodes hooks as `HooksTrampoline.execute()` calls in the order's `interactions` field. These are included in simulation for accurate gas estimates but NOT returned by `/solve` — the driver appends the order's own hooks itself. This includes partially fillable orders with hooks: the envelope accepts both features, and settlement encoding handles `executedAmount` (partial fill fraction) and hook interactions (`interactions[0]`/`[2]`) independently. **Known trade-off:** gas is overestimated for non-first fills because the order cache always includes pre-interactions; fixing this would require tracking `executedAmount` and invalidating the cache.
- **Anvil integration tests** are deferred to COW-1165; the fork spike test (`SpikeRealOrder.t.sol`, attached to COW-1181) seeds that work. Unit tests pin the `settle()` encoding byte-for-byte against Solidity's `abi.encodeCall` for a real mainnet order, and a fake-RPC test pins the wire shape of the estimate request (sender, calldata, both overrides).
